# Biography

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Center for Modeling, Simulation, & Imaging in Medicine, Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and currently seeking a full-time position as a software engineer or simulation research engineer in robotic-assisted surgery or surgical training and planning field.
My research is focusing on developing advanced modeling, simulation technology for virtual surgery, and transitioning those technologies to surgical training and planning in clinical practice. My research interests include multi-physics modeling, soft body modeling, topology change management, algorithm acceleration for real-time interactive simulation, interactive GUIs design and etc. 
I am proficient in several programming languages, such as C++/C and Python, and have solid knowledge of data structures, algorithms.
