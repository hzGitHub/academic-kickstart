The peg transfer task is the first of the five standard psychomotor tasks in the FLS curricula. It consists of using two graspers (one in each hand), to pick up one ring (block) at a time with the left hand, and transfer it to the other hand and finally place the ring on opposite side peg. A virtual basic laparoscopic skill trainer (VBLaST©) has been developed to provide a tool for computerized objective assessment. VBLaST-PT© allows the user to practice the peg transfer procedure within a virtual environment. The user’s performance is recorded in real time and automatically evaluated in terms of completion time, and errors.

1. Developed robust ambidextrous manipulation in virtual environment with haptic feedback (similar to robotic grasping and manipulation simulation)
2. Resolved rigid body dynamics, collision detection/response and positioning
