Currents traveling within the human body between the electrodes do not travel as in a wire; instead, as the whole body is a conductor, the currents try to spread as much as possible with the constraints that it has to start and end at the electrodes. This simulator shows the path of the current when using an active electrode and a dispersive electrode. The Path of the current is shown as the active electrode is moved within the body and reacts accordingly when a new dispersive electrode is selected from the multiple options presented. The learning objectives of this simulator is to demonstrate:
##### Understanding of principles of current diversion {{< youtube larra0McRho>}}
##### Effects of current diversion and how to avoid risks of current diversion {{< youtube h_y4GS5ENcI>}}
